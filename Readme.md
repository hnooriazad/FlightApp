Hi,

This sample project Implements DDD architecture, CQRS and Repository patterns,

Connect to MySql, you can change ConnectionString to connect to your specific MySql Db

It has Dockerfile and Docker compose to run as containers.

It is just a sample, so when you call one of the APIs it will call the Server API and also Add that data to the Database,

We can add more API to just call 3rd Party API or just retrieve data from a database or something else.

We can Create More Commands and Queries with Handlres to have more interaction with the Database.

Feel free to ask any question or request to change or add any solution.

Thanks
