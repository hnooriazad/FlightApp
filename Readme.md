Hi,

This sample project Implements DDD Archirecture and CQRS and Repository patterns,

Connect to MySql, you can change ConnectionString to connect to your specific MySql Db

It has Dockerfile and Docker compose to run as containers.

It just a sample , when you call one the APIs it will call Server API and also Add that data to Database,

We can add more API to just call 3rd Party API or just retrieve data from database or something else.

We can Create More Commands and Queries with Handlres to have more interaction with Database.

Feel free to ask any question or request to change or add any solution.

Thanks
